**`Data Analyst`**

Hey there! Iâ€™m a curious and motivated data analyst who just wrapped up the Data Analytics for Business program at St. Clair College. Always up for learning something new, exploring cool datasets, and turning numbers into stories. Letâ€™s see where this data journey takes me!

### ðŸ§° Project Summary
### [Waze User Churn and Retention Strategy](https://github.com/AnaghaPaul/Waze_User-Churn_Analysis)

![Project Thumbnail](https://github.com/AnaghaPaul/Waze_User-Churn_Analysis/blob/main/images/WAZE.png)  

## Description
- Built a machine learning model to predict user churn in Waze using a synthetic dataset
- Performed data cleaning, EDA, and feature engineering to identify key retention factors (Python, Pandas, NumPy).
- Handled class imbalance with SMOTE and implemented predictive models (Scikit-learn).
- Developed data-driven retention strategies and visualized insights using Tableau & Matplotlib. 
- Key Insights - A noticeable reduction in **driving days** and **activity days** was identified as a strong early warning sign of user churn. These behavioral metrics can be used proactively to improve retention strategies.

### [Polysubstance use and percieved mental health](https://github.com/AnaghaPaul/PolysubstanceUse_PerceivedMentalHealth)

## Description
- Conducted unsupervised clustering (K-Modes, Bayesian Gaussian Mixture) on large-scale survey data (12,000+ samples, 88 features) to identify distinct substance use and demographic patterns.
- Applied Elbow Method, Silhouette Score, and BIC for model evaluation; visualized clusters using Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA).
- Performed statistical association testing (Chi-Square Test, CramÃ©râ€™s V) to examine relationships between clusters and perceived mental health.
- Despite low CramÃ©râ€™s V values, significant associations (p < 0.05) were found, highlighting meaningful patterns in complex, multidimensional social data.
- Validated the relevance of clustering in uncovering mental health trends based on substance use and demographic characteristics.
